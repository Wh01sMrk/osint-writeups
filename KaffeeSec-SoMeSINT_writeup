 - Let's get started 

Hi , so to get started we know Thomas Straussman ,the man we are investigating
uses the handle tstraussman , with this name i can find his social media accounts and for that i 
can either manually look for them or automate the process with tools , in my case i used sherlock
but since the disclaimer says the accounts im looking for are only on reddit and twitter
i stopped the scan, confirmed the links and proceeded with the tasks.

# Let's get started

the first question is what is Thomas favourite holiday, a quick glance at Thomas 
twitter bio gave me the answer , Christmas.

the second question asks whats Thomas birth date, the answer was easily found on reddit since
his first and only post was about him celebrating his birthday , 5 years ago when he was 30 years old
,so i checked the date and to be more sure i also checked the source code of the page to find the data
of the date when the post was posted.
the date is 20 december 1990. format of the answer 12-20-1990 

now i have to find Thomas fiancee's twitter handle, to find her handle i first looked for 
someone named Francesca among his followers/following but found nothing.
checking his replies finally brought me somewhere , scrolling down his replies i found a few posts
he replied to ,posted by a woman named Francesca Hodgelink, of course its her as i also found a clearly
romantic post where he was mentioned , not just one actually.
so i got the name , Francesca Hodgelink, and the last question of this task is , what is
Thomas Background picture of, Buddah.

# Spider...What?

im gonna make this short since i had a few problems with this task , i was supposed to use 
spiderfoot , i had to scan "Thomas Straussman" or "tstraussman" and get a result related 
to a twitter acccount which was supposed to lead me to shadowban.eu.
the questions i had to answer to were:
what was the source module used to find these accounts?
and check the shadowban API , What is the value of "search"?
the source module was sftp_accounts, now the problem was finding the shadowban API
because no matter how many scans i did and how may parameters i changed according to the site,
i couldn't find any result related to shadowban , so i just realized the site was shutdown
a few years ago.
i used way back machine and looked "https://shadowban.eu/.api/tstraussman" set the time to 
2021, clickled on a snapshot and finally found it , {"search": "1346173539712380929" .

# Connections, connections..

the questions of this challenge are quite easy , when i looked at Francesca's twitter i 
instantly found the answers, what is the name of their  cat? gotank. when is Francesca's 
mother's birthday? december 25,  Where did Thomas and his fiancee vacation to? her last
VACATION post was a picture of a city , i used lens and found the name 
of the city, Koblenz in Germany.
and what show does Francesca like to watch? her last post is the answer, 90 day Fiance.
everything is easily findable so no need to make this explanation longer.

# Turn back the clock!!

the last task was slightly more challenging , lets start with the first one of 6.

1) what is the name of Thomas coworker?

the site specify that i have to check Thomas reddit account with the WayBackMachine to find
his coworker, i installed the wbm extension on my browser and checked the page Thomas reddit 
birthday post.
I found a  snapshot from December 21, just one day after the birthday post.
In the comments,i found his coworker: Hans Minik

2) Where does his coworker live?

to find where he lives i simply assumed he lives in Nuuk , Greenland , since he mentions it
in his Reddit bio and works with Thomas.

3) What is the paste ID for the link we found? 

to be honest i had no clue what i was supposed to do ,so i had to take a hint.

"Did you use wayback machine on Hans' profile? If so, did you only look at the 
first saved version? Did you look at the Electric Boogaloo? 
If you have the link: - the flag is the string after the last / of the URL."
 
i checked his reddit profile with the wbm and again checked the first snapshots,
to be clear i didn't find anything at first so i used old.reddit.com instead of just
reddit.com , as the room's guidelines suggested.

the snapshot i was looking for was MAR-23-2021, from this snapshot i found a new post:
https://web.archive.org/web/20210323231748/https://ghostbin.com/paste/ww4ju

the last part after "paste" is the answer.

4) Password for the next link? 

so i opened the link that opened a ghostbin "note" blackmailing Thomas, 
with Thomas personal email and a message from Hans to Thomas,
and a link "https://ghostbin.com/paste/JENxv/" for a ghostbin note 
with the proofs with a password to view the note: 1qaz2wsx
5) Thomas email address was also in the note: straussmanthom@mail.com

6) What is the name of Thomas' mistress?

I had to use wbm because i couldn't simply open the link by pasting it on google,
so i copy pasted this link: https://ghostbin.com/paste/JENxv/1qaz2wsx
and after checking a snapshot from MAR-25-2021 i finally got the answer to the most
important and last question..
The name of Thomas mistress is Emilia Moller.


- note
